        <h2>Historical Perspective:
        </h2>
        <p>The roots of engineering can be traced back to
            ancient civilizations where ingenious minds
            constructed structures like the Pyramids of
            Giza and the Roman aqueducts. However,
            formal education in engineering began
            during the Industrial Revolution when
            the demand for skilled individuals to
            design and build complex machinery and
            infrastructure surged.</p>

        <h2>Education and Future Prospects:
        </h2>
        <p>Engineering education continues to evolve to meet
            the demands of a rapidly changing technological
            landscape. Project-based learning, experiential
            education, and emphasis on soft skills like
            communication and teamwork are becoming integral
            parts of engineering curricula. As the Fourth
            Industrial Revolution unfolds, engineers are
            expected to play a crucial role in shaping the
            future of smart cities, advanced manufacturing,
            and space exploration.
